Docker - Legacy Dockerfiles
---------------------------

This demonstrates the Dockerfile syntax that was often found in the first
version of Binder. It sources the ``andrewosh`` Docker image, which
contained many different dependencies, then installs Julia. We encourage
users to source one of the Jupyter base images as they are more streamlined.
