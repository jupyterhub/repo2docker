`repo2docker` fetches a git repository and builds a container image based on
the configuration files found in the repository.

## Using repo2docker
### Prerequisites

1. Docker to build & run the repositories. The [community edition](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
   is recommended.
2. Python 3.6+.

Supported on Linux and macOS. [See documentation note about Windows support.](http://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#note-about-windows-support)

### Installation

This a quick guide to installing `repo2docker`, see our documentation for [a full guide](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

To install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install jupyter-repo2docker
```

To install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker.git
cd repo2docker
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

The core feature of repo2docker is to fetch a git repository (from GitHub or locally),
build a container image based on the specifications found in the repository &
optionally launch the container that you can use to explore the repository.

**Note that Docker needs to be running on your machine for this to work.**

Example:

```bash
jupyter-repo2docker https://github.com/norvig/pytudes
```

After building (it might take a while!), it should output in your terminal
something like:

```bash
    Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
    to login with a token:
        http://0.0.0.0:36511/?token=f94f8fabb92e22f5bfab116c382b4707fc2cade56ad1ace0
```

If you copy paste that URL into your browser you will see a Jupyter Notebook
with the contents of the repository you had just built!

For more information on how to use ``repo2docker``, see the
[usage guide](http://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).


## Repository specifications

Repo2Docker looks for configuration files in the source repository to
determine how the Docker image should be built. For a list of the configuration
files that ``repo2docker`` can use, see the
[complete list of configuration files](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html).

The philosophy of repo2docker is inspired by
[Heroku Build Packs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks).


## Docker Image

Repo2Docker can be run inside a Docker container if access to the Docker Daemon is provided, for example see [BinderHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub). Docker images are [published to quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/jupyterhub/repo2docker?tab=tags). The old [Docker Hub image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/repo2docker) is no longer supported.
