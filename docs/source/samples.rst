Sample build files
==================

There are many options for specifying your environment with ``repo2docker``.
The following sections describe a few samples to get you started.

.. note::

  These files must be in the root of your repository, or in a folder called
  ``binder`` that is in the root of your repository. If you include a folder
  called ``binder`` in the root of your repository, then all build files *not*
  inside this folder will be ignored.
