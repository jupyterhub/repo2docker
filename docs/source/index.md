# Welcome to `repo2docker`'s documentation

```{important}
Despite the name, `repo2docker` can be used by container technology other than [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/), for example [Podman](https://podman.io/).
```

`repo2docker` lets you **reproducibly build and run user environment container images for interactive computing and data workflows from source code repositories**. Optionally, the container image can be pushed to a Docker registry.

Also, `repo2docker` is the tool used to build container images for [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and the tool used by [BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io) to build images on demand.

:::{grid-item-card} üîß Build reproducible data science environments from repositories
Build a reproducible data science environment as a container image and execute code interactively. Use many [configuration files](#config-files) to control language, tools, and setup instructions.

Push environment images to a container registry for re-use in data science environment services like [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io) or [a Binder instance](https://mybinder.org), or for other communities to build upon your base environment.

Host repositories in: a Git server like [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), an open science repository like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) or [Figshare](https://figshare.com), a hosted data platform like a [Dataverse installation](https://dataverse.org/), an archive like the
[Software Heritage Archive](https://archive.softwareheritage.org).

## What is a user environment container image and why would I build one with `repo2docker`?

A **user environment container image** contains the entire software environment that a user may access from an interactive data science session. For example, it might contain many **programming languages**, **software for data analysis**, or even **content files and datasets** available to anybody that accesses that environment. Container images are built in accordance with the spectifications published by the [Open Container Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/).

Many data science platforms and services like [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io) and [Binder](https://mybinder.org) launch interactive data science sessions **with a user environment container image attached**, meaning that the user gains access to whatever is in the container image. In short, this allows somebody to define and build the user image one time, in a way that users can reproducibly re-use many times.

`Dockerfile`s are the standard way that Docker container images are defined.
However, **building images with `Dockerfile`s takes expertise and time** that is outside the scope of a data scientist or researcher. `repo2docker` makes this workflow more accessible by using community-standard configuration files for computational reproducibility to build user environment container images.

```{note}
You can still use a `Dockerfile` with `repo2docker` if you really want to!
```

In short, `repo2docker` is a tool to reproducibly build and run these user environment container images for data science from source code repositories.

## How `repo2docker` works

When you call `repo2docker` like so:

```
repo2docker <source-repository>
```

It performs these steps:

1. Inspects the repository for [configuration files](#config-files). These will be used to build the environment needed to run the repository.
2. Builds a container image with an environment specified in these [configuration files](#config-files).
3. Runs the image to let you explore the repository interactively via Jupyter notebooks, RStudio, or many other interfaces (this is optional).
4. Pushes the images to a container registry so that it may be accessed remotely (this is optional).
