# Use GitHub Actions to build environment images

The [`repo2docker` GitHub Action](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action) allows you to use `repo2docker` in your GitHub CI/CD to build environment images and push them to a registry. It is a useful way to automate building and pushing images to reduce deployment toil.

See [the `repo2docker` GitHub Action README](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action) for documentation about how to use this tool.
